        <h2>Welcome to Stage Two!</h2>
        <p>
          * You have successfully completed stage one, and now you are invited
          to go to Santa's house to complete stage two. *
        </p>
        <p>* You knocked on Santa's door. *</p>
        <p><strong>Santa:</strong> Hmm... who's that knocking on my door?</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Santa:</strong> Ho ho ho ho... You have successfully completed
          stage one, I see... Welcome to stage 2, and welcome to my house! Ah,
          perfect timing! You know, I am too old and too weak to do some
          tasks... So, are you willing to help me decorate my house for
          Christmas?
        </p>
        <p>* You accepted Santa's quest. *</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Santa:</strong> Ho ho ho... Very nice young man... Thank you
          very much! You can begin decorating from the mirrors, all the way to
          the chimney!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Santa:</strong> *coughs* Argh... I'm sorry, I'll have to go
          rest for a while...
        </p>
        <p>
          * Santa goes to his room, and you started decorating Santa's house. *
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>You:</strong> Huh? What is that? * You found a 5x5 grid pasted
          in Santa's mirror *
        </p>
        <h3>5x5 Grid</h3>
        <p>[Refer to the grid on top]</p>
        <p>
          Ho ho ho... you are not supposed to find this, but anyways... now that
          you've found it, you'll have to solve it! I'll just give you some
          hints so you can solve this faster. Don't forget to continue
          decorating starting from my mirrors to my chimneys after you're done!
