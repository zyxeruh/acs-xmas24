          <strong>Santa:</strong> HO HO HO! Surprised? Did you think you'd
          finish the challenges without seeing me again?

          * You’re startled as Santa steps out of the mirror with a hearty
          laugh. *

          <strong>Santa:</strong> Young one, I must admit, I was impressed by
          your determination to reach this far. But don't get too comfortable
          just yet...

          * Santa hands you a small, intricately wrapped box. Its red and gold
          wrapping shimmers as you open it. Inside, you find a parchment filled
          with cryptic letters and symbols. *
